## How to Play

### Basic Gameplay

- The game board is a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their marks on the board.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

### Input Method

- Rows and columns are numbered from 1 to 3.
- Enter the position in the format `(x,y)` where `x` is the row number and `y` is the column number.
- Example: to place a symbol in the first row and first column, enter `(1,1)`.
- The input must not contain any spaces; otherwise, the program will prompt the player to re-enter the position.

### Advanced and CPU Options

- **Advanced Option**: players can enter their names and choose the mark they want to play with from a list of possible symbols.
- **CPU Option**: play against the computer.
  - In 1-player mode, the player can enter their name and choose their mark as in the advanced option.
  - In 2-player mode, the game defaults to the advanced option.
